   - Vector memory limit bottleneck (8GB) when processing large datasets
   - Missing or inconsistent memory limit configurations
   - R_MAX_VSIZE not properly applied in all configurations

4. **RStudio Server Configuration Inconsistencies**
   - Inconsistent settings in rsession.conf (commented vs. uncommented)
   - Multiple backup files with different configurations
   - Optimized settings not properly implemented

5. **Docker Build Optimization Issues**
   - Commented sections for banking packages and post-install packages
   - Layer optimization needed to reduce image size
   - "Strip: unable to copy file" error during build (file locking issues)

6. **Performance Tuning Issues**
   - Parallel processing slower than single-threaded for some operations
   - 15GB file processing strategy documented but not implemented
   - Missing environment variables for performance tuning

7. **Documentation Issues**
   - Limited README.md content
   - Documentation scattered across multiple files
   - Testing results not integrated into main documentation

8. **Python Integration Issues**
   - Python installed but no clear R integration
   - Missing reticulate configuration
   - No example scripts for R-Python integration

9. **Package Installation Management**
   - Banking packages and post-install packages scripts commented out
   - No clear package management strategy for multi-user environments

10. **Security Configuration Issues**
    - File permissions need review
    - User creation and permissions not fully assessed
