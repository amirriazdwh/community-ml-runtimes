# Conda Runtimes for JupyterLab and CML Workbench
Custom ML runtime for use with Cloudera Data Platform Machine Learning (CML) or Data Science Workbench (CDSW).

This custom ML Runtime example demonstrates how to add the Conda package manager for use with CDSW and CML using wither the stock workbench or JupyterLab.

1. Build either or both of the Dockerfiles (Workbench and JupyterLab)
2. Push the image(s) to a repository
3. Add the runtime to CDSW/CML
4. From a Project, open a new Python 3.9 session and select this ML runtime
